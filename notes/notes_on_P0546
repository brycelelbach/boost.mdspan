The second sentence of motivation needs to be reworded after the colon, I think,
but I'm not 100% sure what you want to say there so I left it alone. E.g.

    The current **P0122** proposal defines a single access abstraction:
    the mapping an integral offset and simple iterator to an element reference.

A question about the last sentence of "Summary of Proposed Change**:

    For example the proposed changes to the ``span`` comparison operators
    have this template parameter even though this proposal requires
    ``sizeof...(AccessProperties) == 0``.

The first time I read this I didn't understand what we meant. What you're saying
is "this proposal requires sizeof...(AccessProperties) == 0 right now, but the
comparison overloads take AccessProperties parameter packs so that they're
future proof". Is this correct?

I've read through everything but the diff (which I'm looking through now). Which
revision of P0122 are these relative to?
