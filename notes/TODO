<span> synopsis should have its own section and stable tag, I suggest [views.span.synop] and 23.7.2
Tags need to be updated
Remove comparison operators in the span class definition section
Should index_type be used in template member functions instead of ptrdiff_t?
firstElem and lastElem should be first_elem and last_elem (or better yet, first and last)
Throws: Nothing language for operator[]
Last subspan() overl9oad says Count but means count
cons vs cnstr in stable tags
Should we add converting assignment operator
Missing definition for dtor
extent data member
Can the converting constructors be noexcept?
Why can't you default construct a span<> with a static size?
Should the ptr "wrapping" constructors be explicit?
In wrapping constructors, "When ptr is null pointer" is awkward
View should not be used as a term of art
Comparison operators noexcept?
Redo SFINAE language for converting ctor
Order of operands in converting ctor postconditions
Put size() before length()
